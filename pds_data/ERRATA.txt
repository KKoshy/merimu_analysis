INTRODUCTION

     This file contains a listing of errors, anomalies, and other notes       
regarding the data archive from the Mars Exploration Rover IMU instrument.

ERRORS, ANOMALIES, AND OTHER NOTES                                            
==============================================================================
                                                                              
   As this archive is being prepared and released, there remain several       
important aspects of the data documentation that are not yet available.       
These missing components result in difficulty in deriving atmospheric         
profiles (density, pressure, temperature) from the current IMU data.          
Precise IMU position and orientation information for both the Rover IMU       
and Backshell IMU are not yet available.  The entry state (3-component        
position and 3-component velocity in a clearly defined reference frame at     
a time that can be related to a time in these data files) of the entry        
vehicle is not included herein. The entry vehicle mass and the                
cross-sectional surface area of the entry vehicles are not yet included.      
  We anticipate that most if not all of this information will be added to     
the archive by the end of 2004 after some documents have gone through a       
release review and after engineering teams have the opportunity to develop    
the needed products amongst their other responsibilities for this and         
other missions.
